# Fibonacci

## This is my internship test for a company called SyncVR

## For this test I had to create a Fibonacci Sequence in an UI canvas. 
## This canvas had to be in a world space canvas. On top of that I had to make a script that would add one fibonacci number each time I pressed the button.
## Once i had completed this I added a few sound effects and then finished the project.
