# Fibonacci

### This is my internship test for a company called SyncVR

#### For this test I had to create a Fibonacci Sequence in an UI canvas. 
#### This canvas had to be in a world space canvas. On top of that I had to make a script that would add one fibonacci number each time I pressed the button.
#### Once i had completed this I added a few sound effects and then finished the project.

#### The android test worked in the beginning while testing with some friends, but at the finished product unity didnt detect my phone anymore. Hopefully the result will be different one this project will be reviewed
